# Welcome to Project Stormycloud
Yes, that's a real name. You can thank Butters from South Park and, of course, deciding to create a repo at 3am for that one.

(if you don't get the South Park reference, watch s13 e9...it's an instant classic)

# Details
My 2017 portfolio. Built with Gulp, Sass, and way too many all-nighters. Also built with lager, but that's a given, right?

# URL
It's a dev url on my server. I'm going to drop it at http://lab.zachfreed.com for now, but eventually will make it's way to the root directory.
